with the newly collected dataset in FBK:
Following analysis needs to be done:
1. Down-sample the signals from 96kHz to 48,24,16kHz
2. GCC-PHAT compuation at different sampling frequencies
   check the change/lose of GCC-PHAT peaks
3. Apply interpolation on the down-sampled signals to see whats the effect caused by interpolation
